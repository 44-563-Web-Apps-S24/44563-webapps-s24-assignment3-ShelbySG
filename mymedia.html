    My favorite movie is The Hunger Games. An interesting fact about this movie (and its franchise) is that the first movie had a different director than the last three. This can be noticed by the shaky camera shots in the first, feeling like we're following Katniss. The last three had stiller shots and a more cinematic feel.

    In The Hunger Games, a dystopian future of North America called Panem sends 24 children to fight to the death on live television once a year. Our protagonist, Katniss volunteers for her sister in the games when her name gets called. She faces twists and turns with her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark.
